# Simple-Virtual-Machine-Project

🖥️ Simple Virtual Machine Description

A simple virtual machine (VM) is a lightweight software-based computer that mimics the functionality of a physical machine. It allows users to run operating systems and applications inside a controlled, isolated environment—perfect for learning, testing, or development.

⚙️ Key Characteristics
Virtualized Environment: Emulates CPU, memory, storage, and networking.

Lightweight Design: Minimal setup and system requirements.

Operating System Support: Can host various OSes (e.g., Linux, Windows).

Isolation: Keeps VM separate from the host system to prevent interference.

Snapshot & Restore: Save VM states for easy rollback during testing.
